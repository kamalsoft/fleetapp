# Synapse Fleet - User Manual

Welcome to Synapse Fleet! This guide will help you get the most out of our platform.

## 1. For Fleet Managers & Dispatchers

### 1.1. Getting Started: The Dashboard

Your dashboard is the central hub for your fleet's operations. Here you can see:

- A live map of all your vehicles.
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like fleet utilization and fuel efficiency.
- Recent alerts for speeding, harsh braking, or maintenance due.

### 1.2. How to Track a Vehicle

1.  Navigate to the "Live Map" tab from the main menu.
2.  Click on any vehicle icon to see its current location, speed, and driver.
3.  To view its recent history, click the "View History" button in the vehicle's detail panel.

### 1.3. How to Create and Dispatch a Job

1.  Go to the "Dispatch" tab.
2.  Click "Create New Job".
3.  Fill in the job details (pickup location, destination, cargo, etc.).
4.  The system will suggest the best-suited driver/vehicle based on location and availability.
5.  Click "Assign Job" to send the details to the driver's mobile app.

### 1.4. Managing Your Drivers

Synapse Fleet provides a complete solution for managing your drivers from recruitment to settlement.

1.  **Onboarding:** Navigate to the "Drivers" tab and click "Add Driver". You can create a profile and send an invitation for them to download the mobile app, where they can upload their CDL and other required documents.
2.  **Document Management:** In each driver's profile, you can view all uploaded documents, approve or reject them, and set expiry dates. The system will automatically alert you before a document expires.
3.  **Settlements:** After a driver completes their work, you can run settlement reports to calculate their pay based on the orders they've fulfilled.

### 1.5. Managing Vendors and Invoices

Keep track of all your external repair shops, parts suppliers, and their associated costs.

1.  **Add Vendors:** Navigate to the "Vendors" section to create a directory of all your trusted partners, including their contact information and specialties.
2.  **Assign Work:** When you create a maintenance work order for a vehicle, you can assign it directly to a vendor from your directory.
3.  **Track Invoices:** When a vendor sends you an invoice, you can log it against the completed work order. This allows you to track total maintenance spend per vehicle and manage payment statuses to ensure vendors are paid on time.

### 1.6. Understanding Your Fleet with Analytics Reports

Our reports turn your fleet's data into actionable insights. Use them to track performance, identify inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions.

1.  Navigate to the "Reports" tab.
2.  Select a report to view. Initially, you can choose between the **Mileage Report** and the **Idle Time Report**.
3.  Use the filters at the top of the page to select a **Date Range** and the specific **Vehicles** you want to analyze.
4.  The report will update automatically.

#### Mileage Report

This report shows the total distance traveled by your selected vehicles over time.

- **What it's for:** Use this report to track vehicle utilization, verify mileage for billing, and plan for IFTA reporting.
- **How to read it:** The line chart displays the daily mileage for each vehicle, making it easy to spot trends or days with unusually low or high activity.

#### Idle Time Report

This report highlights the amount of time your vehicles spend idling (engine on, but not moving).

- **What it's for:** High idle time is a major source of wasted fuel and unnecessary engine wear. Use this report to identify which vehicles or drivers are idling excessively.
- **How to read it:** The bar chart shows the total idle minutes per day for each vehicle. A consistently high bar for a specific vehicle may indicate a need for driver coaching on best practices for shutting off the engine during long stops.

You can export the data from any report as a CSV file for further analysis in other tools.
