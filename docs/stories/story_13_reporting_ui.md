# User Story: Basic Reporting UI

**As a** fleet manager,
**I want** to view a simple report with charts showing mileage and idle time for my vehicles,
**so that** I can identify trends and potential inefficiencies.

---

### Acceptance Criteria:

- A "Reports" page exists in the web application.
- The user can select a vehicle and a date range.
- The page displays a line chart for mileage over time and a bar chart for idle time over the same period.
- The UI gracefully handles cases where no data is available for the selected range.
