# User Story: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline established,
**so that** my code changes are automatically built and tested, ensuring code quality and stability from the start.

---

### Acceptance Criteria:

- Pushing code to a feature branch triggers unit tests.
- Merging code to the `main` branch triggers a build of the relevant service's Docker image.
